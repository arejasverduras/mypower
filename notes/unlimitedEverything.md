üñ•Ô∏è Cognitive

Reading (like a book, or documentation): score: 2. on paper: 5 pages. on the computer: as much as i want with limited time

Following instructions (e.g., building LEGO or Azul): score: 1.

üß† Internal Recovery Systems
Sleep quality: 4. but always seems short

Daily energy level: 3. 

Brain ‚Äúbounce back‚Äù speed after a challenging activity: 2. 60 minutes


I can do most things, but everything has a very clear timer. Rest is mostly 45-60 minutes for new intense activities or music listening. even if the activity is just a couple of minutes. 
Things i have trained more (going outside, computer, making lunch) follow a 'same-duration' resting time. so 60 minutes of computer = 60 minutes of rest.

üîÑ 2. Recovery Rhythm
Can you sketch me your current average daily rhythm?

Wake time:

Key activities + rest periods (how long, what kind):






Wake
730-8.15: wake up + eat
8.15-9.00: rest 45 minutes
9.00 - 11/ 11.30 . computer + including breaks. currently 60-70 minutes of code / chatting , 10 min rest, 4-5 minutes of spiritfarer or braid. Used to do full 120 minutes computer sessions a few months ago. 
11.30 - 13.00 : full rest
13.00: snack, listen to music on headphones followed by 45-50 minute rest
14.00 - 14.45: cook lunch + cleanup and dishes. also a training activity. wear NC headhphones mostly because i am still 'recovering' from the music training before. or scared to mess it up
14.45- 15.30: full rest from lunch. 
15.30 - 17.00 : 60 minutes outside walk + cold swim or surf 90 minutes. try without sunglasses, but have to get used to full sunny days again first.
17.00 - 18.30 : full rest
18.30 - 19.30 : dinner with girlfriend. talking + noise from playground (screams) + dog
19.30 - 20.30: rest from dinner

20.30 - 21.30 : calisthenics at home 3x per week (mo, wed, fri)
21.30 - 22.30: rest from calisthenics

OR
20.30 - 20.35
3 minutes of lego building followed by 60 minutes rest! this one is heavy!
20.35 - 21.35 full rest from lego

after this: maybe a snack, talk with girlfriend. 

22.30 sleep


When is your "peak energy window"?
In the morning while coding, or while going outside in the afternoon. 
sometimes also in the evening around 20.00, if i did not surf in the afternoon.

When do you feel most vulnerable?
- around lunch after coding + music training. sometimes lingering symptoms
- in the evening after LEGO
- during dinner sometimes after an intense outside session. there is sound AGAIN during dinner from dog, girlfriend, playground

üéØ 3. Dream List: Activities You Want Back

You already gave some beautiful ones! Let‚Äôs expand or confirm:

Work & Mental
Coding full days

Listening to music while coding

Learning new tools / frameworks

Physical
Surfing with full turns, no symptoms

Snowboarding (steep, fast, park?)

Calisthenics (to what level?)

Lifestyle
Build campervan again

Move to Spain with partner + dog

DIY projects (house-building?)

Hosting friends / social events

Any more you want to add?

my additions: 
- actually be able to WORK again, starting from home. should be able to have meetings
- also skateboarding in a bowl (used to do it)
- snowboarding park + powder + tree runs. 
- guitar playing!

üß† 4. Worries / Limits / Unknowns
Let‚Äôs also be honest.
What are your biggest fears or worries about recovery?

Are there activities you‚Äôre avoiding?
- adding music / sound to activities. quickly overstimulating
- eye visual stuff: puzzles, azul, that sort of thing
- social gatherings with more then one person
- social visits where i don't feel in control.
- being in places with background music
- travelling longer then one hour by car. i go blindfolded + with headphones and earplugs, but still have to recover

Are there symptoms that scare you?
- pressure between eyes
- long lasting headaches from overstimulation
- feeling super angry or irritated or grumpy from visual or sound

Are there unknowns that feel overwhelming?
- having to go somewhere long

My biggest fear is to not recover because: 
- i keep 'messing it up' 
- missing important parts of training, so not training everything
- holding myself back out of fear
- losing my girlfriend
- going crazy
- not having proper guidance from the medical world makes us have to think about everything myself.. i am glad to have YOU and my girlfriend
- i keep going back to ideas I come up with and kind off ignoring other suggestions or doing them differently. I know i should trust myself, but this feels hard sometimes when things don't go well

Love the idea of naming the journey as a game
